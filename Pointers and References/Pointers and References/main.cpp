 Pointer syntax in c++
 
 To have a pointer point at an object we need to know the address of the
 object.
 The following code demonstrates the declaration of a pointer and basic
 things we can do with the pointers

    //we can declare a poiter pointing to an integer as
    int * ptr = NULL;
    //the value represented by the pointer is an address
    //so like any other integer values it is not assigned any particular
    //value at the time of declaration. So using it before it points to any
    //address can cause a crash. It is hence a good practice to initialise it
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;
    //now we can make ptr point to a by assigning it the address or the memory
    //location where a is stored.
    ptr = &a;
    std::cout<<"Memory Address of a is "<<ptr<<"\n";
    //lets reassign ptr to point to b
    ptr = &b;
    std::cout<<"Memory Address of b is "<<ptr<<"\n";
    std::cout<<"The value of a is "<<a<<"\n";
    std::cout<<"The value of b is "<<b<<"\n";
    *ptr = 40;  //this operation is legal. here we assign the value at the memory location
                //at which variable b is stored thus changing the value.
    std::cout<<"The value of b is "<<b<<"\n";
    
    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // the following is a common mistake:
    //
    // int *ptr = NULL;
    // int a = 10;
    // int b = 20;
    // *ptr = a ; //illegal see that pointer is not pointing to any memory location

    /*
     Using *ptr=x instead of ptr=&x is a common error for two reasons.
     First, because it silences the compiler, programmers feel comfortable about using the incorrect semantics.
     Second, it looks somewhat like the syntax used for initialization at declaration time.
